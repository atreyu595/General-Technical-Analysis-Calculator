Having trouble analyzing your stock/investment portfolios?
Sick of having to pay for overpriced calculators?
Tired of searching the web for tips and tricks to navigate the market?
Or perhaps Gamestop just peeked your interest?
Fear not!

The following program was developed to allow amatuer investors/traders like me to gain insights into one's current
positions. The program allows you to visualize your stock's performance in any particular time frame, furthermore
it also allows investors/traders to visualize their stock's current trajectory, determining buying or selling
opportunities.

Upon entering a time frame and ticker symbol, the investor/trader will be presented with current stock data in-line
with the designated time frame. It will also show trading volumes during a particular time frame.

There are currently 6 Algorithmic Trading techniques and methods one can utilize.

  Simple Moving Average Visualizer: Visualizes short and long-term moving averages, also gives options to view buy
  and sell signals, resistance/support levels as well as revealing the closing price. Better Used for long-term
  Trend Analysis

  Relative Strength Index: A Momentum-based Indicator for a particular stock. Also shows entry and exit points.

  Bollinger Bands: A Volatility-based Indicator, helping determine price fluctuations in the market.

  MACD: Utilizes Exponential Moving Averages, best for short-term trend analysis, better follows new and raw data from
  the market.

  Fibonacci Retracements: Determines entry and exit points, helping determing Support/Resistance Levels.

  Average Volatility Indicator: Another Volatility-based indicator, used to visualize fluctuations in stock prices.

****UPDATE*******
Some new strategies have been included!

  RSI-Bollinger Band Strategy: Combines Momentum and Volatility-Based Indicators into one strategy.
  
  Aroon Indicators: Identifies trend-changes in the market.
  
  Stochastic Oscillator: Another momentum-based indicator, best used for choppy and volatile markets.
  
  Moving Average-Stochastic Oscillator Strategy: Utilizes momentum and trend-based indicators.
  
  Ichimoku Cloud Strategy: Essentially a full-blown trading system. Uses Trend and Momentum-based indicators that determine
                           potential reversals and it's strength as well as support and resistance levels.  

NOTE: As previously mentioned, I'm not a financial nor equity advisor, just an amateur :) Use the program to your discretion.
